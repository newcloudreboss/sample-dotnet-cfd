[![CircleCI Build Status](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/dotnet-sample-cfd)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/dotnet-sample-cfd) [![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/dotnet-sample-cfd)

## Description

The sample .NET core app here is designed to demonstrate what a typical .NET core CI workflow may look on CircleCI.

You can see the CI pipelines for this application running [live on CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/dotnet-sample-cfd?branch=main).

In this sample config, we have a single workflow `build-and-test` which will install and cache our required .NET core packages, and then run tests with xunit by running `dotnet test`, a common .NET framework. This config makes use of the windows executor running SQL Server 2019, which is the database that this app uses to store data.

## Getting Started

If you would like to copy the [config.yml](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/dotnet-sample-cfd/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml) and adapt it to your project, be sure to read the comments in the config file to ensure it works for your project. For more details, see the [CircleCI configuration reference](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/).


## About This App

This sample application is a .NET core ASP.NET application, and utilizes the entity framework to administer a SQL Server database running on the localhost.  This application utilitzes the [OpenAPI/Swagger specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).

### Continuous Food Delivery

When you start up the service, you can open [this page](http://localhost:8080/CFD/1.0.0/ui/) in your browser to view the available API endpoints.



### Front-End

CFD(Continuous Food Delivery) is a sample application that relies on a separate UI framework. If you would like to run this project locally with a complete UI, you can use a valid CFD front-end, such as one of the following sample projects:

| Language |  GitHub | Description |
|---|---|---|
|  Javascript (Vue.js) | [Link](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/sample-javascript-cfd)  | A Javascript Front-End for CFD |
